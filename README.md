There is a login component which loads by default, name and ID is required to access the Trivia questions
once name and ID is provided, use is routed to Trivia questions page. Here there's the header component which simply
displays the Timer and notify it's parent component(QuestionPagecomponent) when time is over, once this parent
receives the message, a pop up component(Result Display Component) shows to display result with a close button. On click of this close
button, user is routed back to login.

On the QuestionPageComponent, ngOnIt() generates a list of questions randomly from a const list of questions
once this page is reloaded, a set of new random questions is generated by communication with the questionservice

QuestionComponent is a resuseable child component of QuestionPageComponent, questions is passed to the input property of this component
and answer is gotten by making the QuestionComponent emit an event when an option is selected.

At the end, funnction displayResult is calculated and displayed to the user.
